Practice 1.1 (Parallel and Massive Computing): OpenMP-based parallelization of a sequential greedy solution for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The work includes data-dependency analysis, a parallelization strategy, and an evaluation of runtime and speedup across different numbers of cores (results collected in an Excel sheet).
